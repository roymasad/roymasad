### Dealer Buddy going Open Source
[![Dealer Buddy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roymasad/roymasad/main/DealerBuddy-Preview.jpg "Dealer Buddy")](https://github.com/NVRL8-SAL/DealerBuddy "Dealer Buddy")

Dealer Buddy was created as an inhouse app at NVRL8 to assist in managing and tracking Poker games to reduce manual human errors and help in calculations.
After we had fun updating it and using it internally, is now time to share it with the open source community for public use and enhancements. 

### Notes

- GPL 3 
- Assist Dealers and Hobbists
